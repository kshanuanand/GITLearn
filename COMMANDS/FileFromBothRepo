This file was created on local repo.

I am adding few comments just for fun.
File should have something, what is the use of empty file.

Below command failed , hence I was unable to push new changes to remot erepository.

git push origin master
To https://github.com/kshanuanand/GITLearn.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/kshanuanand/GITLearn.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.


--- We will run below command to pull latest refs from remote repo and then we will push it to remote repo
git pull https://github.com/kshanuanand/GITLearn.git master






Thid file was created in GitHubGUI Repo.

Typing out something.
Empty file does not look good.
What a fun to write random lines.

Betty baught a butter, but the butter was bitter, so Betty bought a better butter, to make bitter butter better butter.















To merge the conflict I removed the <<<<<<< HEAD, ======= and >>>>>>> <branch name comes here> 
Will add and then commit the change before pushing it to remote repository.
