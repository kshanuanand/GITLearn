This file was created in my Local repo.
I will use below commands to add, commit and push the changes to remote repo.

git add FileFromLocalRepo
git commit -m "This file was created in local repo and will be checked in to remote repo"
git push origin master

--- Output Message from above command
To https://github.com/kshanuanand/GITLearn.git
! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/kshanuanand/GITLearn.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

--- We will run below command to pull latest refs from remote repo and then we will push it to remote repo
